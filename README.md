## *The Content Generator GQEQT (C) is crafted to facilitate teachers process of interpreting, clarifying, and converting the Syllabus and National Curriculum into actionable Course content. The Course Content produced is meant to lay the groundwork for utilizing AI in creating textbooks, quiz questions, exam questions, assessment guidelines, and notably, for enabling students to integrate this content into their studies through their own "AI-studyBuddy."*

This Content Generator is part of, which encompasses interconnected GPT models that can be utilized within the same thread [for further information](https://community.openai.com/t/search-all-gpts-in-chat-with-recent-and-pinned-gpts/604356).

GQEQT (C) utilizes **"micro-prompts"** both as procedural aids and as a means to initiate discussions about the generated content. These micro-prompts play a crucial role in guiding the content creation process, ensuring that the output is not only relevant but also aligned with educational standards and objectives. The specifics and operational guidelines of these micro-prompts are accessible on [GitHub](https://github.com/tikankika/Content-Generator-from-Syllabus-and-N.C.-GQEQT-C-) offering detailed resources and instructions. This strategic method is designed to transform the creation and utilization of educational content, rendering it more flexible, engaging, and valuable, directly supporting teachers in enhancing their instructional practices and student learning experiences.


**Objective:** Leverage a meticulously structured approach, detailed in "Instructions", to cultivate Course Content systematically. This involves a dynamic engagement with the Syllabus and National Curriculum, utilizing the innovative "textbook GPT" concept. This concept revolves around customizing GPT models with micro-prompts to generate concise, curriculum-aligned content effectively.

**Initiation:** To start the content creation cycle, please upload your syllabus and national curriculum documents. These are essential for tailoring the AI-driven content precisely to your educational program's requirements.
