## Biology (biobio02, Swedish)
### Chapter 6.3: Nervsystemet

#### I. Course Syllabus:

- **Identify Relevant Sections:** Cellular biology (neuron structure and function), human anatomy and physiology (nervous system components and functions), and biomedical science (implications of nerve signal transmission and disorders).
- **Connections:** Aligning with the curriculum by linking the nervous system's comprehensive coverage to broader biological principles and health sciences.

#### II. Objectives:

- **Specific:** Structure and function of neurons, synapses, neurotransmitters.
- **Measurable:** Main components of the CNS and PNS and their functions.
- **Relevant:** Transmission of signals throughout the nervous system.
- **Achievable:** Application of nervous system knowledge to neurological functions and disorders.
- **Time-bound:** Preparation for subsequent neuroscience and health education topics.

#### III. List of Concepts:

1. **Neuron:** Basic unit for transmitting information.
2. **Synapse:** Information transfer junction between neurons.
3. **Neurotransmitter:** Chemicals for signal transmission across synapses.
4. **Central Nervous System (CNS):** Brain and spinal cord processing and coordination center.
5. **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS):** Connects CNS to limbs and organs.
6. **Action Potential:** Rapid voltage change across cellular membranes.
7. **Sensory Neurons:** Carry information to the CNS from sensory receptors.
8. **Motor Neurons:** Convey information from CNS to muscles and glands.
9. **Autonomic Nervous System:** Controls involuntary body functions.
10. **Somatic Nervous System:** Controls voluntary skeletal muscle movements.
11. **Neuroplasticity:** The brain's ability to form new neural connections.
12. **Reflex Arc:** Controls reflex actions.
13. **Glial Cells:** Support, nourish, protect neurons.
14. **Myelin Sheath:** Fatty layer increasing signal transmission speed.
15. **Blood-Brain Barrier:** Protects brain from harmful substances.
